# Bro Code - Weather App

Code-along practice with the video ["Python Full Course for free üêç (2024)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix9cRaBkVe0) by Bro Code. It is a simple GUI weather app fetching data from [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/)'s API. I added a window icon (generated with [Bing Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/images/create)) and a listener for the input box to fetch the data upon pressing Enter.

You need an API key from OpenWeather. You can create a free account, get the API key, then assign it to the "api_key" variable in the code or by adding it as an environment variable under the label "API_KEY". Just don't forget to deactivate the API key in your OpenWeather account once you are done with it.

The temperature is in Celsius (`temperature_c`), but the code also calculates it in Fahrenheit (`temperature_f`), so it can be just swapped with the corresponding variable in the code.
